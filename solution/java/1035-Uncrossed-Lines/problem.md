#### [1035. Uncrossed Lines](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/)

**Tag:**  `Dynamic Programming`

We write the integers of `nums1` and `nums2` (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` such that:

- `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`;
- The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

 

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums1 = [1,4,2], nums2 = [1,2,4]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
>
> We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from nums1[1]=4 to nums2[2]=4 will intersect the line from nums1[2]=2 to nums2[1]=2.

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums1 = [2,5,1,2,5], nums2 = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
>
> Output: 3

**Example 3:**

> Input: nums1 = [1,3,7,1,7,5], nums2 = [1,9,2,5,1]
>
> Output: 2

**Note:**

- `1 <= nums1.length <= 500`
- `1 <= nums2.length <= 500`
- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 2000`
